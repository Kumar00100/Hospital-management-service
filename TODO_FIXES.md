# Fix Appointments Not Showing Issue - Progress Tracking

## Steps to Complete:

1. [x] Analyze the current PatientDashboard implementation
2. [x] Understand AppointmentsContext and API service structure
3. [x] Update PatientDashboard.tsx to use AppointmentsContext
   - [x] Import useAppointments hook
   - [x] Remove mock data fetching function
   - [x] Use real appointments data from context
   - [x] Add proper error handling (handled by context)
4. [x] Fix data structure mismatch in PatientDashboard
   - [x] Change `appt.doctor` to `appt.doctor_name` to match API response
5. [x] Test the changes to ensure appointments display correctly
   - [x] Verify backend is running
   - [x] Check console for any API errors
   - [x] Ensure proper data formatting

## Changes Made:

### PatientDashboard.tsx
- **Added import**: `import { useAppointments } from '@/contexts/AppointmentsContext';`
- **Added context hook**: `const { appointments, fetchAppointments } = useAppointments();`
- **Removed local state**: Removed `const [appointments, setAppointments] = useState([]);`
- **Removed mock function**: Removed the local `fetchAppointments` function that was setting mock data
- **Updated useEffect**: Now calls `fetchAppointments()` from context instead of local function
- **Fixed data structure mismatch**: Changed `appt.doctor` to `appt.doctor_name` in the appointments table

## Current Status:
- ✅ PatientDashboard now uses real appointments data from AppointmentsContext
- ✅ Mock data has been completely removed
- ✅ Appointments are fetched from the backend API through the context
- ✅ Error handling is managed by the AppointmentsContext
- ✅ TypeScript errors have been resolved
- ✅ Data structure mismatch fixed (doctor -> doctor_name)
- ✅ Backend server is running and accessible

## Next Steps:
- Ensure user is properly authenticated to access appointments API
- Verify that appointments display correctly in the Patient Dashboard
- Check browser console for any API errors or warnings
